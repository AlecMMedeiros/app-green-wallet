# Overview #

This is a small Reactjs project developed during my time as a web development student.

You can check this project running at: https://app-green-wallet-production.up.railway.app/

Features in this app:

* Login screen : You can use any simulated data to test,
* Wallet Header: You can add expenses by entering the amount, description, currency, etc.
* List of expenses: Shows all registered expenses ordered by id. Also you can 'delete' or 'edit' the expenses.

This app uses "'https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br" to get the actual currencies values.
